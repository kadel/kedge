# Those are packages that OpenShift patches in its vendor directory.
# Those patched libs are not published elswere.
# See https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/15797 for more info.
# We have to ignore them here so they are not downloaded by glide.
# We have to use modfied version of those packages from github.com/openshift/orogin/vendor,
# otherwise OpenShift won't build.
# OpenShift vendoring with all its dependecies is handled by ./scripts/openshift-vendor.sh
